            <p class="normal">Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red</p>
            <p class="emotional">You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed</p>
            <p>Your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team</p>
            <p class="normal">You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me</p>

                Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town</p>
            <p class="normal">And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now</p>
            <p class="emotional">He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was <br>
                'Til we were dead and gone and buried  <br>
                Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same</p>
            <p class="intense">After three months in the grave <br>
                And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you  <br>
                But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame</p>

                You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath  <br>
                Sacred prayer and we'd swear  <br>
                To remember it all too well, yeah</p>

            <p class="emotional">And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much</p>
            <p>But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up</p>
            <p class="high-pressure">RUNNING SCARED, I WAS THERE, I REMEMBER IT ALL TOO WELL</p>
            <p class="emotional">And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  <br>

            <p class="normal">Not weeping in a party bathroom</p>
            <p class="normal">Some actress asking me what happened, you</p>
            <p class="high-pressure">YOU, WHO CHARMED MY DAD WITH SELF-EFFACING JOKES</p>
            <p class="high-pressure">SIPPING COFFEE LIKE YOU WERE ON A LATE-NIGHT SHOW</p>
            <p class="normal">But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come</p>
            <p class="normal">And he said, it's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one</p>

            <p class="normal">I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it</p>
            <p class="normal">After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own</p>
            <p class="normal">Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone</p>
            <p class="emotional">But you keep my old scarf from that very first week</p>

            <h2>Verse 6</h2>
            <p class="intense">And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes <br>
                "I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"  <br>
                From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones  <br>
                I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight  <br>
                And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?</p>
            <p class="normal">Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?</p>
            <p class="intense">'Cause in this city's barren cold <br>
                I still remember the first fall of snow  <br>

                Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well</p>
            <p class="normal">Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there <br>
                Down the stairs, I was there, I was there <br>
                Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there <br>
